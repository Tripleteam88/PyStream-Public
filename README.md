# PyStream-Public
This is where I will release portions of usable code from my personal project "PyStream"
I am not releasing more details for the time being.

##### What is PyStream?

PyStream is a tool for downloading and/or converting 1 or more youtube videos to audio formats.
Its original purpose it to download music off of YouTube, however more features are being added as needed.

##### Why use PyStream?

PyStream allows you to download multiple youtube videos using their url. It does this by reading them from a text file. 
PyStream is the ideal choice for automating the download of videos/audio from youtube since it does not require the user to input new links after each download is complete unlike the online youtube to mp3 converters.
PyStream also comes with a built-in mp4 to mp3 converter tool. Even though PyStream was originally built for downloading music, the use of the converter tool is completely optional. Making it useful as just a video downloader.
