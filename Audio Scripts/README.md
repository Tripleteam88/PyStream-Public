## Audio Scripts

#### What are PyStream audio scripts?
Theses are scripts from one of my personal projects called "PyStream" *(IN DEVELOPMENT)*. It automates YouTube video downloading. The Audio scripts in this folder were created to be used in my PyStream-Audio module, but they are useful enough to be used independently so I decided to release them to GitHub.

#### Usage
Feel free to use this for your own purposes. This is basically a music downloader. Examples for use can be found within the the program.
Note: FileNotFoundErrors can occur when running in some IDEs and Text Editors such as VScode and Pycharm. If such an error is encountered try to run the script via command line or IDLE.

DISCLAIMER: **Although files are downloaded as mp4s; no video content is downloaded** because this is just the **Audio downloader**.
##### Future Features/Releases
A video downloader is a part of the PyStream-Video module and may be released when it has been debugged.

#### Requirments
Python version: ***3.6+***

pip requirements:
pytube
