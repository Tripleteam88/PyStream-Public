## Audio Scripts

#### What are PyStream audio scripts?
Theses are scripts from one of my personal projects called "PyStream" *(IN DEVELOPMENT)*. It automates YouTube video downloading. The Audio scripts in this folder were created to be used in my PyStream-Audio module, but they are useful enough to be used independently so I decided to release them to GitHub.

#### Usage
Feel free to use this for your own purposes. This is basically a music downloader. Examples for use can be found within the the program.
